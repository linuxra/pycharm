class Timer:
    """
    A timer utility class that can be used as a context manager or via direct method calls.
    This class provides a simple way to measure the execution time of code blocks or functions,
    and supports logging the times via a provided logger object.

    Attributes:
        start_time (float): The start time of the timer.
        end_time (float): The end time of the timer.
        elapsed (float): The elapsed time in seconds.
        logger (logging.Logger): Logger object for logging time measurements.

    Examples:
        Using as a context manager with logging:
            logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
            with Timer(logger) as t:
                # some code to time
            print(f"Elapsed time: {t.elapsed} seconds")

        Using via method calls with logging:
            logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
            t = Timer(logger)
            t.start()
            # some code to time

    Displays a macro from a specified file, applying DataFrame styling and uniform color customization
    to column backgrounds and text to enhance visual presentation. The macro data is assumed to be stored
    in a format readable by pandas, such as CSV or Excel. The method reads the file, applies the provided
    DataFrame styles, and sets specified colors for all column backgrounds and text.

    Parameters:
        file_path (str): The path to the file containing the macro data. This should be a path to a
                         readable file format by pandas, such as '.csv' or '.xlsx'.
        styles1 (pandas.io.formats.style.Styler): A pandas Styler object containing styles to be

                                                  visual styles.
        COLUMN_COLOR (str): A color string (e.g., 'yellow', 'red') used to set the background color
                            for all columns in the DataFrame.
        COL_TXT_COLOR (str): A color string (e.g., 'black', 'white') used to set the text color for
                             all columns in the DataFrame.

    Returns:
        None. The method is used for its side effect of displaying a styled DataFrame within
        a Jupyter Notebook or similar environment.
