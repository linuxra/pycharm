class Timer:
    """
    A timer utility class that can be used as a context manager or via direct method calls.
    This class provides a simple way to measure the execution time of code blocks or functions,
    and supports logging the times via a provided logger object.

    Attributes:
        start_time (float): The start time of the timer.
        end_time (float): The end time of the timer.
        elapsed (float): The elapsed time in seconds.
        logger (logging.Logger): Logger object for logging time measurements.

    Examples:
        Using as a context manager with logging:
            logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
            with Timer(logger) as t:
                # some code to time
            print(f"Elapsed time: {t.elapsed} seconds")

        Using via method calls with logging:
            logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
            t = Timer(logger)
            t.start()
            # some code to time
            t.stop()
            print(f"Elapsed time: {t.elapsed} seconds")
    """

        Initializes the Timer instance, setting all times to None and configuring the logger.

        Parameters:
            logger (logging.Logger): Optional logger for logging start, end, and elapsed times.
